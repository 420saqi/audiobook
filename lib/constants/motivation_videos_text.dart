    "We all have two voices in our mind. We have that one voice, that voice that we love to hear, that tells you to stay in bed, to take it easy, telling you not to push yourself too hard, to take the day off, just chill today. But there's another voice in your head. It's a voice that we all wanna run away from, and it's asking you a question. \n\n It's asking you, what could you become? What could you become if you worked as hard as you could? What could you become if you disciplined your mind? What could you become if you stopped taking the easy path? What could you become if you decided to force yourself to do more than ever before? You must listen to that voice. Listen to those questions it's asking. \n\n That voice is the beast inside you, trying to make its way out. When you want something, don't expect the world to just hand it to you. Life's not gonna give you shit for free. There's no handouts. No one's coming to say, oh, you want this? Great, we wanna give this to you.\n\n No, no, life isn't like that. But guess what? That's how most people see success. They think of it as if you just do a few things and you instantly become a winner. They stick to a diet for three days and wonder why they're not a fitness model yet. They do a few tasks they gotta do, have two meetings, send five emails, call ten people, then have the audacity to say, why am I not running a ten million dollar company by now? And it's because they don't get what it really takes. It takes doing the things that most people aren't disciplined enough to do, day after day after day after day, to the best of your ability. \n\nDoing it better than everybody else. Striving for perfection, every single time. It's getting your ass up and working when you don't want to work. It's lifting the weights when all you want to do is lay on the couch. It's focusing on studying when you'd rather be out partying with your friends. And you might hate doing it. It might be the last thing in the world you want to be doing right now. But you've got to do it like you love it. \n\n  Because that is what discipline is. Don't allow your feelings to take control of your life. You're the one in charge. At some point, you gotta get f**king tired of losing, and you gotta f**king play angry. You gotta get to the point where you can't relate to lazy people. You don't speak the same language. You gotta execute. You gotta get it done. Cause the world treats you different when you get it done. You gotta start commanding your mind to do the things that it's gonna take to win. no matter how it feels.\n\n  Rewards come after you work, not before. The only place where success comes before work is in the dictionary. Stop spending time looking for excuses. Look for solutions. That's what winners do. Losers are always looking for the excuse where the winner looks for the solution. You gotta look yourself in the face and ask yourself, am I working hard enough? Am I studying hard enough? Am I doing all that I can do? Am I giving it my all? Am I burning the midnight oil every night? Am I pushing myself to my limits? And don't lie to yourself. Be honest. And if the answer is no, you've got to step up your game and condition yourself to do better. Because all of us can go a little harder.  \n\n Work a little longer. Try a little more. If we decide to. It's your mind that holds you back. You take control of your mind, you can take control of your world. Stop choosing the easy path, the path of comfort and convenience. All it's gonna lead you to is a life of sh- quality, sh- circumstances, and a sh- lifestyle. Choose the hard path, the path of discipline, the path of hard work, the path of consistency, the path of blood, sweat and tears, the path of giving the full measure, the path of going the extra mile. That path will lead you to your dreams, to your goals, to everything you've ever wanted and ultimately to victory. I'm gonna sugar coat this thing for you. I love to tell you, look, you can go out here and get rich, do a couple of things, they happen. You gotta get real doggish. You gotta get downright funky if you wanna make it. If you wanna be ordinary, you ain't even gotta listen to me. Just go on about your business.\n\n  But if you are sitting in this room and you have extraordinary aspirations, then you gonna have to do extra. You put extra on top of ordinary and you come up with extraordinary. There's no other way. But here's the fact, all of you have extraordinary capabilities, all of you. You have to decide if you are willing to do the things to put you in that category. When you quit, your mind says, we're done. So it doesn't expand. There's no expansion when you quit. When you say, fuck you, uh-uh, this sucks, I'm drowning, I'm miserable, I'm suffering, I'm broken, but I'm not going anywhere. What happens to your mind? It says, fuck you. He's not leaving. So we gotta expand. We gotta grow. We gotta figure this f**king thing out. So then these compartments in your brain, they have to work. And then you start to engage parts of your mind that you never engaged before. When you're in suffer mode and you say, I'm not gonna quit. You gotta tell your brain where you wanna go and how you wanna go and how you wanna get there. I realize if I keep going back and going back and going back, your mind will say, okay. We're gonna figure it out, because he is not going to stop. Push through pain enough, and there's glory on the other side of it. But you gotta get through it. I realized I was on the right path because it stopped being easy. I'm fucking exhausted. I'm tired as fuck, but I'm not gonna complain because I asked for this shit. So I'm gonna smile with tired fucking eyes and realize that everything I'm doing on a daily basis is for a fucking reason. You should quit. You should quit quitting. Any path you take to get where you want to be, if that place is worthwhile to go, it's going to be hard. So quit judging your quitting based upon how hard something is, because every single path that you could possibly take to get somewhere where you want to be is going to be hard. Struggle, pain, misery, frustration.\n\n Those are signs that you are on the right path and making progress. where you want to be has gotten there without these struggles, without the bleeding, without the pain, without the misery. Nobody. And if you want to be something great, you are going to have to learn to accept the struggle as part of the recipe. Every single day you need to look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, what am I willing to do to get what I want? And if the answer is, whatever the f**k I have to, you'll get there in time. And most people will give up. But you've got to decide that I'm going to be I refuse to be denied and I'm gonna go all out. Effort is isolated. The reason why effort is isolated, because nobody can dictate it. Because that's all about you. Effort is 100% in the mind. That's what wins championships. That's what wins battles. No excuses. You're an adult now. You're not kids no more. Do it. Girl calling no girlfriend. Do it. Tired or not tired, do it. You said you was gonna do it out your mouth. You a man now. And a man is only as good as his word, not his emotions. championships. So whatever's gonna cause you not to be your best, stop it. It's gonna be a fight. At some point, you gotta go take the life out of it. You gotta take that thing out like it. You gotta take your breath out. So some of y'all, I'll spray the math. Go after it. Go get it. Don't run from it no more. Go get it. You go in there and go get that grade. You go in there and get that information so you can pass that class. You gotta go get it. \n\n You're setting the example every single day of your life. You have to constantly own that motherfucking machine. The machine is your mind. You gotta keep challenging it every day. The price of regret is much heavier than the price of discipline. You never want to wake up one day, one week, one month, one year down the road and go, shh, man, I wish I would have listened to my gut. I wish I would have done this thing. You don't want to live in regret. If there's something you want to get done in work, your relationships, school, whatever it is, do it. Life is one big head game. And once you learn to play the motherfucking head game, it's no longer a game anymore at all. You can start living your life."

const String mindsetText = """
Life is gonna beat you to the ground. Life will break you. Just when you think you've been through the most hell you'll ever face, it'll hit you even harder. And you'll think about quitting every single day. I know what it's like to wake up every day with a sense of dread, and you don't know how you're gonna make it, and you're all alone, and you've gotta say to yourself, when you fail again and again, after facing rejection after rejection.\n\n Many times with tears in your eyes, it's possible. When life knocks you down, sometimes you gotta take two steps back in order to move forward. When you're in that darkness, it's very easy to think you're hopeless. It's very easy to believe it's over for you. It's very easy to feel defeated. It's very easy to sit there and hope that something or someone will come and save you. But the truth is, you gotta save yourself. You can't sit there and wait for the light to come. You've gotta move forward and step your way into the light.\n\n That darkness is temporary, and you can fight your way out of it. it only takes willpower. You think this is it for you? This is far from it. You gotta change your mindset. You gotta start thinking in ways you haven't thought before. You gotta start seeing possibilities for your life you haven't seen before. You can achieve more than you think you can. You're capable of things that would surprise yourself. You've gotta start using your mind to find new ways to break through all these roadblocks in front of you. When you have the will, you'll find a way. And there is always a way. You can get through whatever is in front of you if you decide to. You just gotta stand for what you believe in and don't let anything turn you around. This is your life. This is your dream. Nobody's gonna fight for what you want more than you. If it's gonna happen, it's up to you to make it happen. If you can focus on finding those ways to win, and stop focusing on the ways you're losing, you can make it. \n\n Everything in your way is just life testing you. Do not fail the test. Rise up and destroy these barriers. The people who win, the most common trait they have is they find solutions, while the losers find problems. The winners are relentlessly working to move their lives into a better state of being. They don't care about the facts, they don't care about the odds. All they do is make a plan and execute the plan. of thinking and start seeing the possibilities for you and your current situation. You'll start moving toward victory and away from feeling helpless. But you have got to affirm to yourself that you have what it takes to get through this. Your mind and spirit need to be aligned in the feeling of certainty that I will not stop until I succeed. I will make it happen. No matter what it takes, that this is nothing but a temporary inconvenience. There is nothing that can stop me from reaching my dream. Most people won't do that. Most people give up so easily. They never use the real power inside them to do anything great. Because they can't see those possibilities for their life. Your vision and your perspective of how you see your life is what dictates what you become. If you only ever see yourself as doing just enough to get by, that's all you'll ever achieve. But if you see yourself doing massive things living beyond what other people could possibly conceive, that's exactly what you'll get. Where your focus goes, your energy flows. So when you're going through turbulence on your path to success, you've got to hold that vision firmly in your mind. Don't allow this negative world to throw you off course. Hold the vision and keep walking. Your mind is your strongest weapon. It has the ability to adapt to any level of pain or difficulty imaginable.\n\n It's up to you to harness its power and use it to create new things for you. You can become more creative, more intelligent, more unstoppable. It's only a matter of your mind. You control your mind, you control your life. And when you control your mind, there is nothing out of reach for you. You can be, do, and have whatever you want. The only one who can stop you is you. Some of you have had a marriage fall apart. Some of you have been disappointed in a dream, in a desire, in a goal, in an ambition. And things just haven't worked out the way you wanted them to. And you're starting maybe to feel sometimes a little hopeless. It'll never change. I'll never change. Nothing's ever gonna be any different. And we rationalize with ourselves to where we automatically stop. That's why a bunch of us give up so much in life so quickly. But suppose I told you, the greatest pain of my life is the reason I'm standing here today. See sometimes we think the pain is what controls us, it's actually our subconscious mind. That if we ever tap into that, that's what dictates most of our lives. If you don't control pain, it'll control you. What is it that will make it worth it for you? To face the rejections. to brainstorm and not be intimidated and say I can do this. What is it that will make it worth it for you to raise the bar on yourself and say, I've got some more stuff in me. What is it that will make it worth it for you to make know your vitamin that you become impaled by it? What is it that will make it for you when you wanna give up and things are working against you? What is it that will help you get back up again? when everything is relaxed and peaceful. Yes, we know what we want to be. We know the person we want to become, right? Very easy and calculated in that rhyme, the reason. When nothing's on the line, but as soon as the heart starts to race, or the bill of the hand, the pressure of the lifestyle, the wife, the family, or the job, all of a sudden, oh, we start to settle. I don't want to be that person that's great when everything is going all good, but when something goes wrong, they flee and they want nothing to do with it. I want to be that person that's going to show up rain, sleet, or snow, and they're going to give you everything they got. You got to take my life before you take my drive. I'm talking concrete commitment. I'm talking a commitment that says, I am going to stay true to what I said I would do long after the move that I've set it in has left. Because character is not something we inherit. Character is something we gotta wake up every single day, we gotta fight it, we gotta build it. In the midst of adversity, in the midst of challenges, in the midst of failures, we gotta get up every single day and we gotta fight for peace. We gotta fight for happiness. We gotta fight for joy.\n\n Don't quit, don't give up, don't be a victim, don't take the easy path, don't squander this life. Instead, live with fortitude. There's times when you think, is there anything that can justify as to why I'm always going through something all? Sometimes nothing ever makes sense that you're going through. I'm going through hurt, I'm going through pain, there's death in my family, there's sickness everywhere. But I tell you what, you can't throw in the towel. It just means it's time for you to fight hard. It's time for you to stand tall, lift your heads to the sky and say, I will overcome this. I will fight back. There's always something good that can come from bad. We live in a world, ladies and gentlemen, where people want instant gratification. They want it right now. No, it's simple, but it's not easy. It's a system that if you work the system, it works if you work it. \n\n But make no mistake about it, it's hard. And you are the determining factor. The people that make it in this world look around for the circumstances that they want and if they can't find them, they create them. It's you that you must take personal responsibility to make it happen. It's hard, no easy, it's not an option. However, ladies and gentlemen, what you will discover is that it's worth it. If people ask you, say, how you doing? Even if you're having some difficult times, say I'm blessed and highly favored because anytime you wake up and you don't have a white chalk outline around your body, it's a great day. I say to you, it's possible you can live your dream if it's becoming a diamond, if it's having more, if it's achieving more, to being a better father, being a better mother, whatever it is, it's possible you can live your dream. It's necessary that you have a plan of action, that you're resilient, that you stick to, and you work with the system, that you have the vision and never give up, that you become green and relentless and keep on coming back again and again and again, and that it's you that you gotta take personal responsibility to make it happen, and that it's hard, easy is not an option, and when life knocks you down, jump back up and say, it's not over until I win!

    """ When you start doing anything, the first step, you're excited. You're pumped up. You're gonna be consumed with that thing you're doing. But a week into it, a month into it, a year into it, five years into it, many people begin to lose that fire. They get exhausted. They don't care anymore. They stop trying. So they stop the daily tasks to move toward the goal. And they settle. They settle for, I guess it wasn't meant to be. They settle for, I guess I didn't want to. They settle for the easy road. They settle for mediocrity. They give up, and they let it go. But I'm saying, no, you cannot be like that. You can't allow your dreams and goals to slip by like that. You must stay focused. Don't allow anything to pull you off your game plan.\n\n If you don't finally get your focus in check, if you keep wandering around distracted, if you keep looking at every new thing that pops up in your feed, if you keep trying every single new opportunity, if you keep saying yes to everything, if you keep listening to everybody's complaints, if you keep doing whatever they ask you to do, at some point, you will lose your life. You must reclaim your attention and limit it down to the very few things you care about the most. Cut off anything else that doesn't support you. Embed that long-term goal in your mind. Burn it into your soul. Think about it. Write about it. Talk about it. Hang it up on your wall. But most importantly, do something about it every single day. Start working a plan to get where you want to go and minimize everything else. Getting very clear on the mission and working the plan. Everything else, guess what it gets? A NO! You tune out every voice and noise outside of yourself. And you lock your focus on this one thing.\n\n And you give it everything you've got! What is it that you need to immediately stop doing in your life? To take back control of your time? Is it social media? Is it watching seven seasons of a show every week? And what do you need to start doing? What do you need to start doing every day? Every week? Every month? Every year to be the best version of you? Because whatever you spend your time on is what determines the outcomes of your life. Disciplining yourself buys you freedom to do what you want. Sacrifice leads and gains follow. Don't bother looking for any gains when you haven't made sacrifices. You gotta give stuff up in order to go up. So the question is, what are you willing to give up? Are you willing to skip the parties, cut out the socializing, pass on doing the cool thing on the weekend with your friends? Cause that's what it's gonna take! It's gonna take you dedicating every single fucking moment, every single ounce of energy and effort you have to pull it off! Forget about balance! obsessed with the thing you want and don't allow anything to pull you away from it. If you really want to win, pack your calendar because everything is based off of activity. The more you execute, the more results you will see. You break away from the pack by doing more than other people are willing to. It's impossible for you to lose if you pack your calendar with tasks to be done every single day of the month, morning till night. You do that year after year after year and you will undoubtedly become one of the greatest in in whatever the f**k you wanna do. A champion focuses only on the goal. They don't allow anything else into their mind that won't help them win. And so if you wanna be a winner, what you're focusing on throughout the course of the day has to change. What you're watching, what you're reading, what you're listening to, the conversations you're having, you must now be fully focused on your dreams and your goals. And it all starts with what you're doing today.\n\n Not tomorrow, not next week. Today, when you're great, When you're great, you don't just focus on a month. When you're great, you don't just focus on a week. You focus on the 24 hours in front of you and you work relentlessly to nail it. Most people go through life never discovering what their talents are. Most people never develop their talents. They have skills and abilities, but if you don't nurture them, if you don't develop them, they will never serve you. Your gifts can take you many places if you develop your gifts. And you'll be surprised at the things that you're able to do. When you learn how to block things out, when you learn how to keep that eye single, learning how to concentrate, learning how to focus in, deciding that you're going to focus to develop your skills. You'll be surprised of the ideas that will come to you, of the people that you'll be able to attract, of the opportunities that you'll be able to see. You'll begin to see things that have been staring there, looking you in the face and saying, I can't believe this has been here all this time. When you spend your energy focusing on what other people are doing, instead of executing on your own opportunities, you are setting yourself up to fail time and time again. And this goes against what society is, right? Society is all about gossip, it's all about talk, it's all about who's doing what, and it's never about worrying about what you're doing. Go to a f***ing bar. What's everybody talk about? What their company's doing? What their boss is doing? What their coworkers are doing? What their aunt's doing? What their mom's doing? What their dad's doing? Nobody f***ing cares and it doesn't f***ing matter. That's why you don't see successful people hanging out with people like that. Because they worry about their own s***. They worry about their own actions. They worry about what they execute on. And they worry about how they can get better at it. You've got to focus on you. And as you convince you... As you sell yourself, every day, every day, every day, you will begin to see a difference in the things that you're doing. Selling yourself on your ability to perform a job, to achieve a certain objective, telling yourself every day, here I go again, and I got what it takes. This is my day, so you've got to work on it. When other folk are having a good time, you've got to have the strength of character to concentrate, to read, to digest information. You should be grinding and you looking at the score. The score is what it is. The score ain't about to change because you looked at it. Keep playing the game. Keep grinding. Keep working. And that other stuff will take care of itself. Whatever your head find to do, execute, execute. You gotta learn to kill the noise. Who cares what they say? Dominance. Who cares what they think? Dominance.\n\n You wanna kill your haters? You wanna shut them down? You wanna kill the noise? Nothing succeeds like success. No coach, no trainer, no boss can do it. You versus you. Decide that you're going to push yourself. You have something that you brought to the universe. And that if you decide that my life deserves my developing, this is what I do well. And becoming the best at it and mastering myself in seeing what I have within me. I grant you that your gifts will take you places that will literally amaze you. Never, ever allow anybody to make you feel bad about being so blessed when you've worked your ass off to get it. You decided all the clubs, partying, hanging out, popping bottles with models and all that shh. That ain't for me. I'm gonna be out here running in the hot sun, practicing, playing basketball, shooting on weekends while everybody else is clubbing and hanging out.\n\n You got your focus right. Change the way you see yourself and begin to tend to the personal details. Understand that nobody's going to take care of your business better than you. You've got to work on yourself. You've got to develop yourself. You've got to talk to yourself day in and day out. Selling yourself on you and on your potentials. Stay focused. Don't listen to nobody. What's on your mind, just do it. Because what's destined for you, you're going to get it. As you begin to develop and expand your skills and your talents and your vision of yourself, You will always be in control of your destiny. There's no limitations. There's no excuses. Just slow down.""";

    """ People want to find peace immediately, but the only way you'll find real peace is by going to war with yourself every single day. The real battleground is in your mind. That's where the fight is. You lay down with it, you get up with it, you go to work with it. It's not haters, it's not enemies, it's not liars, it's not back biters, it is you. You're the only one who can stop you. And I need you to make a declaration right now. No more excuses. This moment right here is the last time you let yourself off the hook. You've got to become obsessed with improvement. Every day you got to get better. There are those of you who buy a new piece of tech every time a new one is released. Every new phone that comes out, you get it. Every upgrade, you get it. You are constantly upgrading your technology and you've not upgraded yourself. You gotta level yourself up every single year, every single month, every single day.\n\n You should always be striving to do better than you did last time. So many of you say, I want to be a millionaire. I want to graduate at the top of my class. But your value system says you believe in relaxing more than you believe in grinding. Your value system says you'd rather party than become successful. Your value system says you're a consumer and not a producer. And if you're going to go to the next level, your values are going to have to change. The secret is, make a plan, execute the plan, become obsessed with the plan, and make it your entire life, from the time you wake up to the time you go to bed, for 20 fucking years. It's the day-to-day disciplines. It's the eating the meals, doing the workouts, doing the best you can in your career, doing the best you can for your family. Those are the things that are gonna create your superpower so that you can go through life being an unstoppable force. Those things that never get done, never get done because they never get started.\n\n There is no perfect time to start. \n\n You gotta start now with changing your life. Stop sitting on the. bitch and get in the motherfucking game. Let's make this the year where we stop that shit. Years of mediocrity is what causes people to be bitter. If you want to get around bitter and complaining people, get around people who are not seeing much activity. They're bitter, they're complaining, they're cynical and they're jealous because nothing is happening, because nothing is going on in their life. And if you want to stop that from happening to you, wake up in the bed and know what you're going after. Get up out of the bed with an agenda. When you have an agenda, you don't spend time worrying about how you feel because it doesn't make a difference how you feel. You woke up with something to do and if you don't start changing your attitude, you will miss your altitude. The problem is not the condition, it's a matter of discipline. There is no shortcut to excellence. You gotta force yourself to get up and get it done every day of your life. Commit yourself to executing on the plan on a daily basis, no matter what's going on around you. Stop hoping, stop wishing for great things to happen to you and get up and work for them. Make them happen. Take full ownership of your time, of your mind, of your day. It is the struggle, it is the wrestling, it is the pulling, it is the trial, it is the temptation, it is the stumbling and falling and getting back up again. and the intimidation that gives you foundation to create a legacy. It is worth it to look bad for a little while and come up looking good for a lifetime than to look good for a minute. I come down in a flash, and in order to do that, I've gotta become disciplined. I've gotta go through some struggle.\n\n I've gotta get used to suffering, because the lifestyle I'm building, it can't be instantly obtained. It takes that blood, sweat, and tears of commitment. I learn in the doing. I learn in the fight. My strength tolerance increases. My ability to handle pain increases. My wisdom increases. I become tougher. I become stronger. I become more and more of an unstoppable beast. Everybody wants to prize, but nobody loves the process. Everybody wants to be a champion, but nobody's willing to put in the work that it takes to be a champion. Everybody wants to hold up the trophy and say, man, I did it, but nobody's willing to put in the work that it takes to do it. I love the process. I love the thought of working for what I want. And I firmly believe you never supposed to wish for it more than you're willing to work for it. Your expectations never supposed to exceed your effort. But a lot of people, they wish, and they're not willing to work. And the great thing about life, life has a funny way of testing all of us and seeing how bad we really want what it is that we say we want. When you work for something, it gives you a different type of attachment to it. The harder you work, the harder it is to surrender. That's why cats can give up so easy. They ain't got nothing invested. But when a cat work for something, like when a cat been sacrificed for something, well you gonna have a cold day in hell before you take it from him. You can't be good and be a legend. You can't be great, really, and be a legend. You gotta be phenomenal. I want you to push for legend. It is the process of the grind that shaped you and forms you is not the game. You think you become a champion on the field, you don't. You become a champion when ain't nobody watching you. You're doing your own drills in your own way. You're doing what coach tell you to do and you're doing your own stuff. You become a champion in the dark when ain't nobody looking. You don't become no champion when you put no dog or helmet on. You'll become a champion the way you eat. You'll become a champion the way you think. You'll become a champion in your grind. When nobody knows what you're doing, when you putting in those extra reps, when you watching those videos and you getting this vibe, when you change your music, it's the process that makes you sweet. there are only 86,400 seconds in a day. And you gotta not only operate it, you gotta do it quick, you gotta do it fast, you gotta do it in a hurry. Why? Because there's somebody else who's on the same track you are, somebody else, they're on the same path that you are, it's somebody else just like you trying to do it, and sometimes they're working just as hard as you're working. They're putting in just as much sweat, just as much tears, just as much blood, but you just gotta do it what? You gotta do it faster than they do it. You gotta do it quicker than they do it.\n\n Are you listening to what I'm saying? That's why I wake up at three o'clock in the morning getting up at six, you might be smarter than me. You might, you might have more privilege than me. You might, you might have more resources than me. You might, but I'm gonna get up earlier than you and I'm gonna do it faster than you do it. So by the time you get up with all your resources, by the time you get up with all your privilege, by the time you get up with all your stuff, I've already finished the race, are you hearing me? It's hard, yup, it's hard, yup, it's difficult, yup, why? Because the process is weeding out the weak. It's weeding out the weak. And so sometimes you got to play hard, you got to play physical, you got to play tough. Listen to me, this is how you do it over six, seven years ago with no money, no human resources, no building, no funding, no support.\n\n The first thing we did was we dreamed, we wrote the dreamed out, we slept the dream, we ate the dream, we rehearsed the dream, we looked at the dream, we talked about the dream, we slept with the dream, we woke up to the dream, we wore the dream, and now boom, it's our reality. And for some of you, you stop dreaming. You dream for a week and you stop because things around you don't look good. You dream for a month, then when you get hit in the mouth, you quit and you give up. You dream for a while and when people tell you crazy, when people tell you stupid, when people tell you can never get done, you stop dreaming and you go back to knowledge. And I dare you to use your imagination. I dare you when you're broke to use your imagination. I dare you when you're rich to use your imagination. I dare you under every single circumstance, keep dreaming. Keep looking at your dream, keep focusing on your dream, keep going after the dream because that's where true success is.""";
